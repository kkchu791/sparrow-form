# sparrow-form
A personal info form built with react and material

live site: https://sparrow-form.netlify.app/

to run:
```
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

libraries used:
- material-ui
- react

#### How would you improve upon the design to make it an easier and more beautiful experience for users?

- make it look prettier for mobile browsers
- Have datepicker show up when clicking on the input field. Right now it only shows up when clicking on the calendar icon
- Add more validations to the rest of the fields
- One thing I debated over was having the fields be two columns rather than one column. Some might say having DOB and Job Title in the same row is a bit odd, but I opted for the layout based on the page layout. I thought the way it was spaced with two columns looked better, and when the browser reached a certain width, I stacked the fields into one column.
